# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bingo demo application. TypeScript/Node.js project, currently in early scaffolding stage with environment configuration in place but no application code yet.

## Environment Management

This project uses **varlock** for environment variable management. The `.env.schema` file defines required variables with type and sensitivity annotations following the `@env-spec` standard (https://varlock.dev/env-spec).

Required environment variables:
- `LINEAR_API_KEY` — Linear API key (sensitive)

Key commands:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.varlock/bin:$PATH"
varlock load              # Validate env vars (shows masked values)
varlock load --quiet      # Silent validation (exit code only)
varlock run -- <command>  # Run command with validated env injected
```

**Security rules:** Never read `.env` directly, never echo secrets, never include secrets in commands. Use `varlock load` to validate and `cat .env.schema` to inspect variable definitions.

## Linear Integration

Linear skill is installed at `~/.claude/skills/linear/`. Key scripts:
```bash
varlock run -- npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/linear/scripts/linear-ops.ts whoami
varlock run -- npx tsx ~/.claude/skills/linear/scripts/query.ts "<graphql>"
```

## Auto-Generated Files

- `env.d.ts` — TypeScript type definitions for environment variables, auto-generated by varlock. Do not edit manually.
